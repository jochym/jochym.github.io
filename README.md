My published projects
-----------

Here is a list of my current project pages maintained on GitHub (with project repos naturally).

* [Elastic](http://jochym.github.io/Elastic) a set of python routines for calculation of elastic properties of crystals (elastic constants, equation of state, sound velocities, etc.).
* [qe-util](http://jochym.github.io/qe-util) a set of utilities for using Quantum-Espresso with ASE and ipython notebooks.
* [qe-doc](http://jochym.github.io/qe-doc) a set of tutorials for Quantum-Espresso environment inside IPython notebooks developed as a colaborative project between the Institute of Nuclear Physics and the University of Saskachwan. 

These are just the published projects with proper project pages. The rest of my projects are hosted on [my github page](http://github.com/jochym), but they are not ready for *public consumption* yet. I will add them here as they mature.
